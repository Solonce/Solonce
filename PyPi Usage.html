        The process for pushing your own package to PyPi is surpsingly simple.<br><br>
        Youre going to need to make a folder that contains all these files, in this <i>specific</i> filetree structure.<br><br>

        <div class="code-snippet">
            <p>
                <br>
                │Package Folder<br>
                │<br>

                ├── src<br>
                │   └── main<br>
                │       ├── __init__.py<br>
                │       └── main.py<br>
                ├── README.md<br>
                ├── LICENSE<br>
                ├── pyproject.toml<br>
                └── setup.cfg<br>
                <br>
            </p>
        </div><br>
        All of these files can be empty upon creation, as I’ll provide all the information thats vital. Let’s break down what each of these files should include. <br><br><br>

        <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 200%"><u>Folder Architecture</u></p>

        <div style="font-weight: 600">__init__.py</div>
        <p class="bullet"> 
            This is an init file, meaning when you add ‘import mypackage’ to your script, it’ll run this file. This is where you can pull certain methods, classes, etc from any python files in the /src folder. It allows you to ‘cherry-pick’ what functionality you want to add from the python files youre uploading to PyPi.<br><br>

            In my experience, __init__.py should really only be used to load methods from main.py or equivlent python script. However, if you want additional functionality when first importing a package, here is where you would do it.<br><br>

            Here is an example of what might be included in your __init__.py file.
        </p>
        <p class="code-snippet">from .main import some_method</p>
        <p class="bullet">
            It is important to note how we are importing main.py. We are calling specifically ‘.main’. This is an identifier that lets the package module know to look within the same folder as __init__.py and import that file.<br><br>

            That’s really all that’s needed in the __init__.py file, you can import as many functions as you like or write any functionality. The only thing of importance is just to note that <b>when the package is imported, this file will be ran.</b>


        </p><br>

        <div style="font-weight: 600">main.py</div>
        <p class="bullet"> 
            This should be pretty self explanatory, this is the main python file that holds the functionality that __init__.py will import.
        </p><br>

        
        <div style="font-weight: 600">README.md</div>
        <p class="bullet"> 
            This is a markdown file that is needed when you upload a file to PyPi, so anyone who is reading the documentation knows how to use your package.
        </p><br>

        <div style="font-weight: 600">LICENSE</div>
        <p class="bullet"> 
            This file does not <i>require</i> anything inside. However, it is advised to include some license to show what is and is not allowed to be done with your package.<br><br>

            I recommend browsing <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">https://opensource.org/licenses/ </a> to find a list of open source licneses that you are free to use.
        </p><br>

        <div style="font-weight: 600">pyproject.toml</div>
        <p class="bullet"> 
            This is a pretty standard file that helps build the package and build the wheels for the package.<br><br>
            
            pyproject.toml has pretty consistent data across python packages, I’d recommend you use the code below. It’s just to make sure that the package can build correctly, and that the correct wheels for the package can be built.
        </p>
        <p class="code-snippet">
            [build-system]<br>
            requires = [<br>

        <div style="font-weight: 600">setup.cfg</div>
        <p class="bullet"> 
            This is the lion’s share of the manual editing involved with uploading a package to PyPi. Its going to hold information about the name of the package, the version, who the author is, contact info, etc. The only important thing to note about this file, is that whenever you push new versions of your package to PyPi, you have to change the version number of the package in this file. Everything else will be set up and can be left alone after you first push the version.

            Below is a 'blank' version of a setup.cfg file.

        <div class="bullet">
            <p>
                So there are really only 7 areas we need to concern ourselves with.
            </p>
            <div style="font-weight: 600">Package Name:</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                This is the name that you will use when downloading your package from pip. <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> The folder found in src needs to be the same name as the package name in the setup.cfg file.
            </p>

            <div style="font-weight: 600">Version:</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                The version of your package.
            </p>
            
            <div style="font-weight: 600">Author:</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                The name you want displayed with your package.
            </p>
            
            <div style="font-weight: 600">Author Email:</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                While you can leave it blank, this is a way for people to contact you if you so desire.
            </p>
            
            <div style="font-weight: 600">Package Description:</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                A quick description of your package for people to view when browsing packages on PyPi.
            </p>
            
            <div style="font-weight: 600">Github URL:</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                This doesn’t have to be github, but often is. It's just a way for people who download your package from PyPi to view your github and code a bit easier.
            </p>
            
            <div style="font-weight: 600">Github Bugtracker URL:</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                Assuming you’ve linked your github, this is a way for people on PyPi to see what errors have come about with your package. Additionally, it gives users a very easy way to get in contact with the creator of the package should an error arise.
            </p>
        </div><br><br><br><br>


        <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 200%"><u>Building the Package</u></p>
        Perfect! Now that the folder containing our package is all set up, we need to build it, and upload it to PyPi. We first need to ensure that the package ‘build’ and ‘twine’ are installed and up to date.<br><br><br>

        <p class="code-snippet">>pip install build<br>>pip install twine</p><br><br>
        
        Or if you already have the packages installed, you can update them via these commands:<br><br><br>

        <p class="code-snippet">>pip install --upgrade build<br>>pip install --upgrade twine</p><br><br>

        Next, we need to build the python package. So enter a command prompt and navigate to the folder that contains all the files. Then we need to run:<br><br><br>

        <p class="code-snippet">>python -m build</p><br><br>

        This will run for a minute or two and then dump the built package into the /dist folder.<br><br><br><br>

        <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 200%"><u>Creating PyPi Account</u></p>
        Next we need to create an acount on PyPi: <a href="https://pypi.org/account/register/">https://pypi.org/account/register/</a><br><br>

        Then we need to create an API key. I find this way to be consistently the easiest way to push packages to pip.<br><br><br><br>


        <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 200%"><u>Shipping to PyPi</u></p>
        After creating an API key, we are ready to ship our package to pip! We will need to do the following command:<br><br><br>

        <p class="code-snippet">>twine upload dist/* -u __token__ -p [API_KEY]</p><br><br>

        Now let's break that command down, in case it is a little confusing.<br><br>

        <div class="bullet">
            <div style="font-weight: 600">twine upload</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                This is the part of the command that will tell twine to upload our package.
            </p>

            <div style="font-weight: 600">dist/*</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                This is the part of the command that tells twine where our package was built.
            </p>

            <div style="font-weight: 600">-u token</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                This is the part of the command designated the username, and since we are using an api key, we give the username ‘__token__’. <b>This is not a placeholder name, it is case sensitive and ‘__token__’ is required as the username when using an API Key.</b>
            </p>

            <div style="font-weight: 600">-p [API_KEY]</div>
            <p class="bullet">
                This is the part of the command designated to the password. Since we are using an API key, we will paste whatever key was given to us by PyPi.
            </p>
        </div>

        After this, we can run the command, and viola! Our package is on PyPi and can be installed using pip.<br><br>

        We can test it out by running the command:<br><br>

        <p class="code-snippet">>pip install mypackage</p>





    </div>
