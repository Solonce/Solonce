            Born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, my journey into the world of machine learning began at a tender age. Homeschooled from ages 8-18, I integrated programming into my curriculum, with a particular fascination for genetic evolutionary algorithms. This early exposure to higher-level programming set the stage for my academic pursuit in Cyber Security at Champlain College in Burlington. However, the pandemic and a growing disinterest in cybersecurity led me to drop out. This detour took me into the culinary world, where I honed skills like discipline, team building, and stress management under the mentorship of renowned chefs in Burlington's top-rated restaurants.

            My experience in the tech realm, though largely undocumented due to my perception of programming as a hobby, is rich and varied. In 2015, I developed a cost-saving calculation program for BNSF. During my stint at Champlain, I interned as a Technical Intern, crafting an automated network scanner in Linux. My most recent endeavor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting stock prices. My proficiency spans across languages like Python, JavaScript, C#, C++, C, Ruby, Lua, Processing, and Java, with recent work focusing on N-Step DQNs, RNNs, and Neural Networks.

            My passion for machine learning is unwavering. I recall a college philosophy class where I ardently advocated for the positive impact of AI on humanity. I envision a future where machine learning surpasses our current capabilities, and I'm eager to be at the forefront of this revolution. My journey has been challenging, especially in grasping the dense concepts of machine learning and translating them into programming. Yet, my homeschooling background, which instilled in me the ability to self-learn, has been instrumental in overcoming these hurdles.

            Looking ahead, my immediate goal is to transition from the physically demanding culinary world to a mentally stimulating career in machine learning. Long-term, I aspire to contribute to groundbreaking projects in the industry. My strengths lie in my rapid learning ability, passion for acquiring new skills, and a professional demeanor ingrained by my father's teachings. Outside of work, I'm a music enthusiast, an artist with a unique style, and a culinary aficionado.
