        <div class="section-header">Introduction</div>
        My name is Solomon Ince. I am a 22 year old from Fort Worth, Texas. In recent years I have lived and operated out of Burlington, Vermont. I currently work in the high end culinary scene, but I am looking to transition to a job more suited for my programming and developing skills. I attended three semesters at Burlington's Champlain College; every semester hitting a 4.0 GPA and getting onto the Dean's list every semester. Being both homeschooled and online schooled in my youth, when the decision was made to transition to virtual classes for the pandemic, I made the difficult choice to unenroll. To no fault of my educators and teachers, I felt as if I wasn't receiving adequate the teachings and schoolings I was paying for with my tuition.<br><br>

        Although this decision was not easy, I felt as if it allowed me to learn some of the soft skills that are vital to many aspects of life. Not to mention a few hard skills as well.<br><br>

        <div class="section-header">Experience</div>
        The only in-office experience I have for programming and developing was an internship I took during my time at Champlain for the first two semesters of my enrollment. Most of that time was spent building an Automated Network Scanner. This tool was successful and the paper for it can be seen <a href="google.com">here</a>. It was a wonderful way to tie the degree I was pursuing (Cyber Security) and my love for programming.<br><br>

        I have plenty of experience working with Python, Javascript, and C#. However, I also have a pretty decent grasp on HTML, CSS, Bash, and C. I've been programming since I was 8 years old(part of my homeschool curriculum), so I am able to pick up languages and syntax fairly quickly.<br><br>

        <div class="section-header">Benefits of Kitchen Work</div>
        With years of working in kitchens under my belt, I value a job well done. I've had the disciplines of many chefs passed down into my day to day life, and I find that it translates very well to discipline in development. On top of the discipline I have for my personal and professional work, I also am able to work under pressure extremely well. With a full dining room of guests waiting eagerly for your food, it really forces you to focus on the details to ensure that nothing slips through the cracks. Additionally, I find my time spent in kitchens translates to project development extremely well. When working on developing dishes over the course of weeks or months, to achieve a beautifully composed plate of food at the end gives me the same rush I get from completing a difficult project I've sunk countless hours into. Being able to look at the final product and being excessively proud of it motivates me to reach that end point.<br><br>
    
        My only professional achievement in the field of programming has been that of my Automated Network Scanner. However, I have recently begun developing a portfolio on my github. Even with years of programming under my belt, I only recently began to upload my projects to github. Call it stubbornness, imposter syndrome, or lack of knowledge, but unfortunately years of my projects have been lost to time. However, I am working on rebuilding any projects I can and uploading them to my github!<br><br>
